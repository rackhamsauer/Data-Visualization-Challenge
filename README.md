Mouse Tumor Study Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of tumor volume data from a study on mice. The goal of the project was to analyze the effects of different medications on tumor growth and explore patterns in the data.

Observations and Inferences
At the top of this notebook, three key observations were made from the analysis:

Most medications, including Placebo, have similar means for tumor volume, indicating that they don’t do a very effective job at removing the tumors from the mice. The exception is Ramicane and Capomulin, which have slightly lower tumor volumes on average.

Ramicane and Capomulin stand out due to their lower mean tumor volume, indicating that these medications seem to help reduce the tumor size. These medications also have the smallest standard deviation and variance, suggesting they are the most consistent in reducing tumor volume across the mice.

There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. Mice that weigh more tend to have larger tumor volumes, as evidenced by the data.

Analysis Summary
This was a challenging but rewarding analysis. The complexity of managing multiple dataframes, creating visualizations, and interpreting the data required a lot of effort. Initially, I struggled with creating the correct dataframes to pull the needed information, as there were so many different datasets in play. By the end of the project, I found myself confusing the dataframes due to the number I had created.

Creating graphs was another area of difficulty, as I’m more familiar with Excel for visualizations. However, after some guidance and research, I decided to use Seaborn for the graphs, as we had used it in previous project work. With the help of a tutor, Seaborn seemed to be the most visually appealing and effective tool for showcasing the differences between the medications.

Tools and Resources Used
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn for data visualization and plotting.
Python for scripting the analysis.
ChatGPT for troubleshooting and code assistance.
Stack Overflow for resolving coding issues and bugs.
YouTube for learning resources and solutions to specific problems.
Peer support from classmates for collaborative problem-solving.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and the necessary packages (e.g., Pandas, Seaborn) installed.
Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis and run the code cells to replicate the calculations and visualizations.
Review the graphs and tables generated to explore the effects of the medications on tumor volume in mice.
Contribution
This project was completed with the support of previous lessons, peer collaboration, and additional resources like ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, and YouTube. The starter code provided was extremely helpful in outlining the project’s structure and providing a foundation for the analysis.
